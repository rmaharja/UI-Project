# A Simple responsive UI design using React (in 3 hours total)

### Some Key Decisions:
* Used vh & vw for font size for more responsive UI (especially withou media queries)
* Used percent for padding and margin whenever possible for a more responsive design
* Set default number of columns to 3 and default row height to 400px for user to see how the app might work
* 

### Things to work on:  

* Adding media queries: *Setting more max and min sizes (for font and images) depending on screensize
* CSS Animation using keyframes for changing number of columns.
