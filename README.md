# A Simple responsive UI design using React (in 3 hours total)

### Some Key Decisions:
* Used vh & vw for font size; used percent for padding and margin whenever possible for a more responsive UI especially (especially without media queries)
* Set default number of columns to 3 and default row height to 400px so the user can visualize the app.
* Set max number of columns to 47; any entering value greater than 47 distorts the columns

### Things to work on (did not get to it in 3 hrs):  
* CSS Animation using keyframes for changing number of columns and row height
* Adding media queries: *Setting more max and min sizes 
* Find exact font to match the given design
* Testing designs on different browsers and different screen sizes/devices
* Refactoring to make code more efficient/clean
* Refactor componenets to make it easier to understand
* Adding more comments to the code to make it easier for other developers to understand the code
* Adding redux to make it easier for state management
* Changing the method for exceeding max number of columns (sending a clean message instead of alerts)
